TrendCast
TrendCast is a machine learning-powered forecasting tool designed to predict trends in time-series data, such as stock prices or power grid metrics. Built with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and deep learning models, TrendCast provides a simple interface for users to generate accurate forecasts using historical datasets and pre-trained models.

Features
Time-series forecasting using deep learning (Keras/TensorFlow)

Pre-trained models for stock price prediction

Example datasets for experimentation (e.g., powergrid.csv)

Interactive web app interface (Flask)

Jupyter Notebook for model exploration and customization
